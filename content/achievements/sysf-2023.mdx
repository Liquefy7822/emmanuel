# Singapore Youth Science Fair 2023  

## Overview  
I participated in the **Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF) 2023**, a national platform for young scientists to showcase innovative research. My project explored the intersection of **environmental science** and **education**, investigating how microclimates within school grounds impact both local temperatures and student well-being.  

## About SYSF  
The Singapore Youth Science Fair celebrates student-led STEM projects with real-world relevance. It emphasizes creativity, scientific rigor, and the potential to address societal challenges—aligning perfectly with my goal to study how urban greenery can mitigate heat in schools.  

## My Project  
**Title:** *"Investigating the Microclimate Variations Across a School Campus"*  

### **Objective**  
To quantify how greenery (e.g., trees, gardens) affects temperature and humidity in different areas of a school, with two key motivations:  
1. **Environmental:** Urban heat islands worsen global warming—schools can model sustainable cooling solutions.  
2. **Educational:** Studies suggest cooler environments enhance focus; we tested this correlation firsthand.  

### **Methodology**  
- **Hardware:** Built portable data loggers using **Arduino UNO** and **DHT22 sensors** to record temperature/humidity.  
- **Data Collection:** Gathered **5,000+ data points** over 72 hours at 5 sites (forested areas, courtyards, concrete-heavy zones).  
- **Engineering Fix:** Designed a **waterproof casing** for sensors in rain-prone areas (a major challenge!).  
- **Analysis:** Processed data in spreadsheets, created scatter plots to visualize thermal differences.  

### **Key Findings**  
1. **Green spaces cooled adjacent zones:** Classrooms near trees were **2.5°C cooler** on average than those near asphalt.  
2. **Humidity buffer:** Forested areas maintained more stable humidity levels, reducing "muggy" conditions.  
3. **Low-cost impact:** Our prototype cost <$50 per unit, proving scalable for other schools.  

## Skills Developed  
- **Technical:** Arduino programming, sensor deployment, statistical analysis.  
- **Scientific Communication:** Explained complex data to judges using clear visuals.  
- **Adaptability:** Revised sensor housings mid-trial after rain interference.  

## Recognition & Achievements  
- **Distinction Award** for "robust experimental design and societal relevance."  
- **Best School Delegation** (our team’s collective projects earned top honors).  
- **Visitor Engagement:** Educators asked about implementing our findings in their schools.  
- **Mentor Feedback:** Our teacher noted the project’s potential for **long-term climate studies**.  

## Impact & Reflections  
This project transformed how I view science:  
- **Small data → Big change:** Proof that hyperlocal research can influence infrastructure decisions.  
- **Failure = Progress:** Rain ruined our first sensor batch—but taught us to prototype faster.  
- **Interdisciplinary wins:** Merged engineering (hardware) with environmental science (data).  

## Future Directions  
- **Expand monitoring:** Track seasonal changes to propose year-round cooling strategies.  
- **Advocate for green design:** Share findings with school administrators to plan shade structures.  
- **Inspire others:** Mentor juniors in replicating the study for their campuses.
