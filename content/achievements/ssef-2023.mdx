# Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2023  

## Overview  
I was honored to participate in the prestigious **Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2023**, where I investigated the microclimate of my school—a project born from my curiosity about environmental science and its impact on daily life. This experience deepened my passion for data-driven research and sustainable design.  

## About SSEF  
The Singapore Science and Engineering Fair is a national competition that recognizes and rewards creative scientific research and innovation among pre-university students. It provides a platform for young talents to present their projects to experts and peers, fostering collaboration and intellectual growth.  

## My Project  
**Title:** *"Investigation on the Microclimate of Various Locations at a School"*  

**Objective:**  
To analyze how greenery influences a school’s microclimate, motivated by two key factors:  
1. **Climate relevance:** Urban heat islands exacerbate global warming—understanding microclimates can inform greener school designs.  
2. **Human impact:** Research shows cooler environments improve student focus; we wanted to quantify this effect in our own classrooms.  

**Methodology:**  
- Deployed **Arduino-based sensors** to collect thousands of temperature/humidity data points across 5 locations (e.g., forested areas, concrete-heavy zones) over a weekend.  
- Engineered a **weatherproof housing** for forest sensors to protect against rain (a key challenge).  
- Processed raw data into spreadsheets and visualized trends using **scatter plots** to compare thermal profiles.  

**Findings & Results:**  
- **Forest adjacency mattered:** Classrooms near greenery were **2–3°C cooler** than those near concrete pavements.  
- **Data-driven impact:** Our results supported proposals to add plants or shade structures to warmer zones.  
- **Problem-solving highlight:** Prototyped a low-cost sensor housing that could withstand monsoon conditions.  

## Skills Developed  
- **Technical:** Arduino programming, sensor calibration, large-scale data analysis (Excel/Google Sheets).  
- **Scientific Communication:** Presented findings visually through graphs and explained implications to non-experts.  
- **Engineering:** Designed and iterated on field-ready equipment.  

## Recognition & Achievements  
- **Distinction Award** for rigorous methodology and clear environmental relevance.  
- Contributed to our school winning **Best School Delegation**—a first in recent years!  
- **Visitor feedback:** Judges and peers praised our "professional-grade" setup and actionable conclusions.  
- **Mentor’s note:** Our physics teacher highlighted the project’s potential for **long-term climate monitoring** at schools.  

## Impact & Learning  
This project taught me that **small-scale science can drive real change**. By proving how greenery cools classrooms, we sparked discussions about eco-friendly school renovations. Beyond the data, I learned:  
- How to **troubleshoot hardware** in unpredictable conditions (e.g., rain).  
- The power of **visual storytelling**—graphs made our findings accessible to everyone.  
- That **curiosity + grit** can turn a simple question into award-winning research.  

## Future Directions  
I plan to:  
- Expand this research by tracking seasonal microclimate variations.  
- Explore applications in **urban planning**, such as heat-reduction strategies for public spaces.  
- Mentor younger students in sensor-based projects, paying forward the guidance I received.
